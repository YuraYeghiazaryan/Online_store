# Online_store
Welcome to my GitHub repository for my online store project! 
This project allows users to create a user account and shopping cart, 
with an initial balance of $1000. Users can also create products for 
the store, specifying their category, name, and price.
Once products have been created, users can add them to their cart,
view the total cost, and make a purchase. When a purchase is made, 
the appropriate amount is debited from the user's account.
